# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

I've been trying to figure out what `.each` would be used for.  It seems that, since we are looping the argument through each element of the array, we can use it to modify or perform operations the elements.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

I know we will be doing more with this at some point. I'm learning about what it is for.  I know we can define parameters inside of a block and use .each to iterate over each element.  I'm just not excatly sure why.  

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

I understand how the .each loop works - how it iterates over each element until it goes through the entire array, then ends. I think its great to find the elements that contain certain characters, or length of the string.  I suppose there is a data analysis purpose, but I'll be research other utilizations.
